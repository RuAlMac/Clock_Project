<h1>RADM Clock Project</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to the repository for my clock project! This project was inspired by redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joshr120/"> u/joshr120</a>. See his post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArduinoProjects/comments/1caxkm6/my_clock_made_of_24_clocks_and_48_stepper_motors/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The various parts of this project are listed below.</p>

<p><h3>Custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Individual Clock Board:</strong> 24 used, one for each analog clock (2 steppers, one for each hand)</li>
  <li><strong>Clock Cluster Board:</strong> 4 used, one for each segment (6 clocks)>/li>
  <li><strong>Power Routing Board:</strong> 1 used, includes fuses for distributing power safely to all steppers and microcontrollers</li>
  <li><strong>Small Parts Board:</strong> 50 used, two per clock for hall effect sensors for steppers, more for miscellaneous components</li>
</ul>
</p>
